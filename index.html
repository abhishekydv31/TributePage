        <p><b style="color:grey;">Keshav Chandra</b> was born in 10th October 1966, completed his primary education from Smt. Amari Devi School Chattarpur, Azamgarh and Secondary Education from Maulana Azad Inter-College. As soon as he completed his 11th he gave entrance exam for Indian Navy SSR and he says I quote "by the grace of god without specifically studying for the exam I cleared". </p>
        <p>1982 was the year my father has cleared the SSR exam. It was lucky year for him as he was also got married to my mother <b>Lal mati Devi</b> in the month of May. My father often shares his training experience and how he has enjoyed his training journey. He has served in various Indian Navy Ship like INS Rana, Guldar and Viraat.
